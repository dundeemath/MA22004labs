### Packages

In this lab, we will explore and visualise the data using the **tidyverse** suite of packages. 

Recall that all the necessary packages can be loaded using the `library` command. 


```{r load-packages, message=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library(MA22004labs)
library(tidyverse)
```

### The **Human Freedom Index Data**

:::{.tipblock}
**Human Freedom Index Data**: The Human Freedom Index is a report that attempts to summarise the idea of "freedom" through various variables for many countries around the globe.
It serves as a rough objective measure for the relationships between the different types of freedom --- whether it's political, religious, economic or personal freedom --- and other social and financial circumstances. The Human Freedom Index is an annually published report by the Cato Institute, the Fraser Institute, and the Liberales Institut at the Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom. 
:::

In this lab, you'll analyse the **Human Freedom Index Data** from 2008-2016. You will summarise a few of the relationships within the data graphically and numerically to find which variables can help tell a story about freedom. The data we're working with is in a data frame called `hfi`, short for Human Freedom Index, made available by the openintro package.

:::{.exerciseblock}
What are the dimensions of the `hfi` dataset?

```{r glimpse-hfi, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r glimpse-hfi-hint}
dim(`___`)

# Don't forget to run `glimpse(hfi)` in the console or 
# explore the data frame through the RStudio environment pane
```
:::

:::{.exerciseblock}
What plot would you use to display the relationship between the personal freedom score, `pf_score`, and one of the other numerical variables? Plot this relationship using the variable `pf_expression_control` as the predictor. Does the relationship look linear? Suppose you knew a country's `pf_expression_control`, or its score out of 10, with 0 being the most, of political pressures and controls on media content. Would you be comfortable using a linear model to predict the personal freedom score?

```{r scatter-plot-1, exercise = TRUE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE}

```

```{r scatter-plot-1-hint}
ggplot(`___`) + geom_point()
```

```{r scatter-plot-free}
question_text(
  "Enter your observations as free text below.",
  answer("C0rrect", correct = TRUE),
  incorrect = "Okay! [even if this button is red]",
  try_again_button = "Modify your answer",
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```
:::

The correlation coefficient quantifies the strength of a linear relationship between variables. A correlation coefficient can be computed using the `cor` function. A perfect linear association has a correlation $\pm 1$. A correlation near zero indicates the absence of a linear association. 

```{r cor, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
hfi |>
  summarise(cor(pf_expression_control, pf_score, use = "complete.obs"))
```

Here, we pipe `hfi` to the `summarise` command and set the `use` argument of `cor` to "complete.obs" since there are some observations of NA (and we want to ignore these and focus on complete observations only).

## Sum of squared residuals

In this section, you will use an interactive function to investigate what we mean by "sum of squared residuals". An interactive function `plot_ss` is provided; however, you will need to run this function in your console, not in your markdown document. Running the function also requires that the `hfi` dataset is loaded in your environment.

Think back to how we described a single variable's distribution.
Recall that we discussed characteristics such as centre, spread, and shape.
It's also helpful to describe the relationship of two numerical variables, such as `pf_expression_control` and `pf_score` above.

:::{.exerciseblock}
Consider your plot of `pf_expression_control` vs `pf_score` from the previous exercise. Describe the relationship between these two variables. Make sure to discuss the form, direction, and strength of the relationship and any unusual observations.

```{r scatter-plot-reflection}
question_text(
  "Enter your observations as free text below.",
  answer("C0rrect", correct = TRUE),
  incorrect = "Okay! [even if this button is red]",
  try_again_button = "Modify your answer",
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```
:::

Just as you've used the mean and standard deviation to summarise a single variable, you can summarise the relationship between them by finding the line that best follows their association.
Use the following interactive function to select the line that you think does the best job of going through the cloud of points.

```{r plotss-setup, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# We must remove records with `NA` responses.
hfi <- hfi |> drop_na(pf_expression_control, pf_score)
# We consider a smaller sample of just 30 rows, just because.
hfi_samp <- sample_n(hfi, 30)
```

```{r plotss-expression-score, exercise = TRUE}
# Here, we demonstrate the call & output of `plot_ss`; 
# this command will run interactively from your console. 
plot_ss(x = hfi_samp$pf_expression_control, y = hfi_samp$pf_score)
```

After running this command, you'll be prompted to click two points on the plot to define a line.
Once you've done that, the specified line will be shown in black and the residuals in blue.
Note that there are $m$ residuals, one for each of the $m$ observations (above we set $m = 30$).
Recall that the residuals are the difference between the observed values and the values predicted by the line,

\[e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i \,.\]

The most common linear regression method is to select the line that minimises the sum of squared residuals.
To visualise the squared residuals, you can re-run the plot command and add the argument `showSquares = TRUE`.

```{r plotss-expression-score-squares, exercise = TRUE}
plot_ss(x = hfi_samp$pf_expression_control, y = hfi_samp$pf_score, showSquares = TRUE)
```

Note that the output from the `plot_ss` function provides you with the slope and intercept of your line and the sum of squares.

:::{.exerciseblock}
Using `plot_ss` in the console, choose a line that does an excellent job of minimising the sum of squares. Repeat this process several times and record the sum of squares. What was the smallest sum of squares that you captured?

```{r plot-ss-reflection}
question_text(
  "Enter your observations as free text below.",
  answer("C0rrect", correct = TRUE),
  incorrect = "Okay! [even if this button is red]",
  try_again_button = "Modify your answer",
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```
:::

## The linear model

It is somewhat cumbersome to try to get the correct least squares line, i.e. the line that minimises the sum of squared residuals, through trial and error.
Instead, you can use the `lm` function in `R` to fit the linear model (aka regression line).

```{r m1, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
m1 <- lm(pf_score ~ pf_expression_control, data = hfi)
```

The first argument in the function `lm` is a formula that takes the form `y ~ x`.
Here it can be read that we want to make a linear model of `pf_score` as a function of `pf_expression_control`.
The second argument specifies that `R` should look in the `hfi` data frame to find the two variables.

The output of `lm` is an object that contains all of the information we need about the linear model that was just fit.
We can access this information using the summary function.

```{r summary-m1, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
summary(m1)
```

Let's consider this output piece by piece.
First, the formula used to describe the model is shown at the top.
After the formula, you find the five-number summary of the residuals.
The "Coefficients" table shown next is critical; its first column displays the linear model's y-intercept and the coefficient of `pf_expression_control`.
With this table, we can write down the least squares regression line for the linear model,

$$ \hat{y} = 4.61707 + 0.49143 \cdot \mathsf{pf\_expression\_control} \,.$$

One last piece of information we will discuss from the summary output is the Multiple R-squared, or more simply, $R^2$.
The $R^2$ value represents the proportion of variability in the response variable explained by the explanatory variable.
For this model, 63.42% of the variability in `pf_score` is explained by `pf_expression_control`.

:::{.exerciseblock}
Fit a new linear (least squares) model that uses `pf_expression_control` to predict `hf_score`, or the total human freedom score. Using the estimates from the `R` output, write the regression line equation. What does the slope tell us about the relationship between human freedom and the amount of political pressure on media content?

```{r answer-1a, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r answer-1b}
question_text(
  "Enter your observations as free text below.",
  answer("C0rrect", correct = TRUE),
  incorrect = "Okay! [even if this button is red]",
  try_again_button = "Modify your answer",
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```
:::

## Prediction and prediction errors

To add a least squares line on top of a scatter plot, we add a new geometry item using `geom_smooth` (or `stat_smooth`, which is just an alias).

```{r reg-with-line, exercise = TRUE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE}
ggplot(data = hfi, aes(x = pf_expression_control, y = pf_score)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

Here, we are literally adding a layer on top of the existing scatter plot.
`geom_smooth` creates the line by fitting a linear model.
It can also show us the standard error `se` associated with our line, but we'll suppress that for now.

This line predicts $y$ at any value of $x$.
When predictions are made for values of $x$ that are beyond the range of the observed data, it is referred to as *extrapolation* and is not usually recommended.
However, predictions made within the range of the data are more reliable.
They're also used to compute the residuals.

:::{.exerciseblock}
If someone saw the least squares regression line and not the actual data, how would they predict a country's personal freedom school for one with a 6.7 rating for `pf_expression_control`? Is this an overestimate or an underestimate, and by how much? In other words, what is the residual for this prediction?
```{r answer-ls-plot-reflection}
question_text(
  "Enter your observations and thoughts as free text below.",
  answer("C0rrect", correct = TRUE),
  incorrect = "Okay! [even if this button is red]",
  try_again_button = "Modify your answer",
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```
:::

## Model diagnostics

To assess whether the linear model is reliable, we need to check for (1) linearity, (2) nearly normal residuals, and (3) constant variability.

### Linearity

Using a scatterplot, you already checked if the relationship between `pf_score` and `pf_expression_control` is linear.
We should verify this condition by plotting the residuals vs fitted (predicted) values.

```{r residuals-pre}
m1 <- lm(pf_score ~ pf_expression_control, data = hfi)
```

```{r residuals, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "residuals-pre"}
ggplot(data = m1, aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +
  xlab("Fitted values") +
  ylab("Residuals")
```

Notice here that `m1` can also serve as a data set because stored within it are the fitted values ($\hat{y}$) and the residuals.
Also, note that we're getting fancy with the code here.
After creating the scatterplot on the first layer (first line of code), we overlay a horizontal dashed line at $y = 0$ (to help us check whether residuals are distributed around 0), and we rename the axis labels to be more informative.

:::{.exerciseblock}
Is there any apparent pattern in the residuals plot? What does this indicate about the linearity of the relationship between the two variables?

```{r linearity-free}
question_text(
  "Enter your observations and thoughts as free text below.",
  answer("C0rrect", correct = TRUE),
  incorrect = "Okay! [even if this button is red]",
  try_again_button = "Modify your answer",
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```
:::

### Nearly normal residuals

To check this condition, we can look at a histogram:

```{r hist-res-pre}
m1 <- lm(pf_score ~ pf_expression_control, data = hfi)
```

```{r hist-res, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "hist-res-pre"}
ggplot(data = m1, aes(x = .resid)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .25) +
  xlab("Residuals")
```

or a normal probability plot of the residuals:

```{r qq-res-pre}
m1 <- lm(pf_score ~ pf_expression_control, data = hfi)
```

```{r qq-res, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "qq-res-pre"}
ggplot(data = m1, aes(sample = .resid)) +
  stat_qq() + stat_qq_line()
```

Note that the syntax for making a normal probability plot is a bit different than what you're used to seeing: we set `sample` equal to the residuals instead of `x`, and we set a statistical method `qq`, which stands for "quantile-quantile", another name commonly used for normal probability plots (`stat_qq_line()` draws a straight line through the points on the qq-plot).

:::{.exerciseblock}
Does the nearly normal residuals condition appear to be met based on the histogram and the normal probability plot?

```{r normality-free}
question_text(
  "Enter your observations and thoughts as free text below.",
  answer("C0rrect", correct = TRUE),
  incorrect = "Okay! [even if this button is red]",
  try_again_button = "Modify your answer",
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```
:::


### Constant variability

:::{.exerciseblock}
Based on the residuals vs fitted plot, does the constant variability condition appear to be met?

```{r variability-free}
question_text(
  "Enter your observations and thoughts as free text below.",
  answer("C0rrect", correct = TRUE),
  incorrect = "Okay! [even if this button is red]",
  try_again_button = "Modify your answer",
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

:::

The following exercises refer to variables found in or derived from the **Human Freedom Index Data** in the data frame `hfi`, which is packaged with `MA22004labs`. 

:::{.tipblock}
**Human Freedom Index Data**: The Human Freedom Index is a report that attempts to summarise the idea of "freedom" through various variables for many countries around the globe.
It serves as a rough objective measure for the relationships between the different types of freedom --- whether it's political, religious, economic or personal freedom --- and other social and financial circumstances. The Human Freedom Index is an annually co-published report by the Cato Institute, the Fraser Institute, and the Liberales Institut at the Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom. 
:::


1.  Use `ggplot` to construct a scatterplot of `pf_expression_control` vs `pf_score`. Use `pf_expression_control` as the predictor. Using the scatterplot, describe the relationship between these two variables. Make sure to discuss the form, direction, and strength of the relationship and any unusual observations. **[2 marks]**

2.  Using `lm`, fit a least squares line that uses `pf_expression_control` to predict `hf_score`, the total human freedom score. Using the estimates from the output, write the regression line equation (remember to use $\LaTeX$). What does the slope tell us about the relationship between human freedom and the amount of political pressure on media content? **[6 marks]**

3.  Choose another freedom variable and a variable you think would strongly correlate with this new freedom variable. Use `ggplot` to produce a scatterplot of the two variables and fit a linear model. At a glance, does there seem to be a linear relationship? **[3 marks]**

4.  How does this relationship in Exercise 3 compare to the relationship between `pf_expression_control` and `pf_score`? Use the $R^2$ values from the two model summaries (i.e., from `lm`) to compare. Does your independent variable seem to predict your dependent one better? Why or why not? **[6 marks]**

5.  What's one freedom relationship you were most surprised about and why? Using `lm`, display the model diagnostics for the regression model analysing this relationship. **[3 marks]**
