### Some formatting options
library(tidyverse)
options(width = 80)
theme_set(theme_bw(base_size = 10))
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = "", fig.width = 5, fig.asp = 0.75, fig.align = "left", warning = FALSE, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE)
```

To complete this lab report, we load the following packages and datasets.

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(MA22004labs)
# ADD YOUR PACKAGES/DATASETS BELOW

```

### Exercise 1

Update/change/delete the example text below as appropriate.

Note the \#-signs before the text turn "Exercise 1" into a heading. \# for title, \#\# for heading, \#\#\# for sub-heading, \#\#\#\# for sub-sub-heading, etc. Only put one whitespace after a period; end a line with two spaces to start a new paragraph.

Some formatting options: **Bold text**, *italic text*, ~~strikethrough text~~, superscript^2^, [link to google](www.google.com). 

Ordered Lists can be made:

1. endash --
2. emdash ---
3. ellipsis ...
   1. Note the three spaces at the start of this line. 
   2. neat?
  
Unordered lists:

* one bullet
* two bullet
   * sub-item
   * sub-item 

> Here is a block quote.

Here is some inline math $2+2=4$ and $x^2$ and $X_1, \dots, X_n$, and here is some display math:
\[F(x) = \int_a^x f(t) dt \,.\]

Within the `R` chunk, named "answer-1", below you can insert code that will run and produce output in your Knitted report. Note that each chunk must be assigned a different name. 

```{r answer-1}
# Insert your code for here. 
# Within a code chunk the # starts a comment line. 
# Comments are not evaluated by R.
```

Now for something fancy: the command `Sys.Date()` prints the date. The date is: `r Sys.Date()`.
